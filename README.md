## QNA
### Why does **Discord ‚Üí Server** not work‚ùì
- You need to configure these in `cfg/discord_redux.cfg`: 
    - Set up a [Discord bot](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) and copy its token.
    - Enable [Developer Mode](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID#h_01HRSTXPS5CRSRTWYCGPHZQ37H) and copy the [channel id](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID#h_01HRSTXPS5FMK2A5SMVSX4JW4E).

### Why does **Server ‚Üí Discord** not work‚ùì
You need to set up a [Webhook](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) in the channel that will be used as a relay.

### Why don't Player Avatars not show up‚ùì
You need to register your [Steam Web API Key](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).
> ![NOTE]
> Avatars are only cached once on player join‚Äº

### `/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version 'GLIBC_2.38' not found`
As far as my (albeit, limited) Linux knowledge goes, you need to be the latest version of your distro.
> ![WARNING]
> Untested on Windows‚Äº

### Why using `!` commands instead of Discord slash commands‚ùì
Because I haven't figured them out yet. It's that simple. üòÖ
